//! Type checked partial references.
//!
//! This crate provides type checked partial references for rust. Type checked partial references
//! are one solution to solve [interprocedural borrowing conflicts][interprocedural-conflicts].
//!
//! # Tutorial
//!
//! With this crate it is possible to declare typed parts (using the [`part`] macro) and to assign
//! struct fields to these parts (by [deriving `PartialRefTarget`](partial_ref_derive)).
//!
//! ```
//! use partial_ref::{part, PartialRefTarget};
//!
//! part!(pub Neighbors: Vec<Vec<usize>>);
//! part!(pub Colors: Vec<usize>);
//! part!(pub Weights: Vec<f32>);
//!
//! #[derive(PartialRefTarget, Default)]
//! pub struct Graph {
//!     #[part = "Neighbors"]
//!     pub neighbors: Vec<Vec<usize>>,
//!     #[part = "Colors"]
//!     pub colors: Vec<usize>,
//!     #[part = "Weights"]
//!     pub weights: Vec<f32>,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! It is then possible to convert a reference to a value using the [`IntoPartialRef`] and
//! [`IntoPartialRefMut`] traits, which are derived alongside PartialRefTarget. Note that a mutable
//! partial reference must itself be mutable for mutable access.
//!
//! ```
//! # use partial_ref::{part, PartialRefTarget};
//! # use partial_ref_tests::doctest_helpers::*;
//! use partial_ref::IntoPartialRefMut;
//!
//! let mut g = Graph::default();
//!
//! let mut g_ref = g.into_partial_ref_mut();
//! ```
//!
//! You can access parts using the [`part`](PartialRef::part) and [`part_mut`](PartialRef::part_mut)
//! methods.
//!
//! ```
//! # use partial_ref::{part, PartialRefTarget, IntoPartialRefMut};
//! # use partial_ref_tests::doctest_helpers::*;
//! # let mut g = Graph::default();
//! # let mut g_ref = g.into_partial_ref_mut();
//! use partial_ref::PartialRef;
//!
//! g_ref.part_mut(Colors).extend(&[0, 1, 0]);
//! g_ref.part_mut(Weights).extend(&[0.25, 0.5, 0.75]);
//!
//! g_ref.part_mut(Neighbors).push(vec![1, 2]);
//! g_ref.part_mut(Neighbors).push(vec![0, 2]);
//! g_ref.part_mut(Neighbors).push(vec![0, 1]);
//!
//! assert_eq!(g_ref.part(Colors).len(), g_ref.part(Neighbors).len());
//! assert_eq!(g_ref.part(Colors).len(), g_ref.part(Weights).len());
//! ```
//!
//! We can now write a function that takes parts of a reference. The type of such a partial
//! reference can be written using the [`partial`] macro, which expands to a combination of [`Mut`],
//! [`Const`] and [`Ref`]. Again the parameter `g` here must be mutable to allow mutable access to
//! the referenced value. To call such a function we use the [`borrow`](PartialRef::borrow) method,
//! which will re-borrow just the required parts.
//!
//! ```
//! # use partial_ref::{part, PartialRefTarget, IntoPartialRefMut, PartialRef};
//! # use partial_ref_tests::doctest_helpers::*;
//! # let mut g = example_graph();
//! # let mut g_ref = g.into_partial_ref_mut();
//! use partial_ref::partial;
//!
//! pub fn add_color_to_weight(
//!     mut g: partial!(Graph, mut Weights, Colors),
//!     index: usize,
//! ) {
//!     g.part_mut(Weights)[index] += g.part(Colors)[index] as f32;
//! }
//!
//! add_color_to_weight(g_ref.borrow(), 1);
//!
//! assert_eq!(g_ref.part(Weights)[1], 1.5);
//! ```
//!
//! So far everything could have been written using plain built-in references. This changes as soon
//! as we want to iterate over the neighbors while invoking our function. Usually we couldn't pass a
//! mutable reference to the graph while holding the iterator over the neighbors.
//!
//! This can be easily done using partial references which support splitting. Splitting means
//! turning a single reference into two references where each has a subset of parts, so that each
//! mutably referenced part belongs only to a single reference. This is done by the
//! [`split_borrow`](PartialRef::borrow) and [`split_part`](PartialRef::split_part) methods.
//!
//! ```
//! # use partial_ref::{part, PartialRefTarget, IntoPartialRefMut, PartialRef, partial};
//! # use partial_ref_tests::doctest_helpers::*;
//! # let mut g = example_graph();
//! # let mut g_ref = g.into_partial_ref_mut();
//! let (neighbors, mut g_ref) = g_ref.split_part_mut(Neighbors);
//! let (colors, mut g_ref) = g_ref.split_part(Colors);
//!
//! for (edges, &color) in neighbors.iter_mut().zip(colors.iter()) {
//!     edges.retain(|&neighbor| colors[neighbor] != color);
//!
//!     for &neighbor in edges.iter() {
//!         add_color_to_weight(g_ref.borrow(), neighbor);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This covers the basic functionality of this library. Beyond that this library also supports:
//!
//! * Partial references to nested structs using [`Nested`] and [`nested_part`].
//! * Generic functions with bounds on available parts using [`HasPart`].
//!
//! # Notes
//!
//! Some documented items are marked with *(internal)*. Typical code using this library doesn't
//! explicitly refer to them. Nevertheless they often appear in error messages and are thus part of
//! this documentation. These items also have to be public for the inference driven meta programming
//! to work. Code that is generic over parts of partial references might also need them.
//!
//! Many traits in this crate are marked as unsafe without documenting any requirements for
//! implementations. This does not mean they are safe to implement, but rather means that they are
//! not intended to be implemented outside of this library. Feel free to file an issue if you have a
//! good reason to implement them so the requirements can be documented.
